# Algorithms and Datastructures

Descriptions taken from [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).

# Algorithms

* Binary Search
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Merge sort
* Quicksort

# Datastructures

* Binary Expression Tree
* Dynamic array
* Graph
* Hash table
* Heap
* [Linked list](https://github.com/akullpp/algodat/tree/master/src/main/java/de/akull/datastructures/linkedlist)
* Queue
* Stack
* Tree
* Trie

# Notes

The implementation is done with an educational purpose in mind, which means that the datastructures and algorithms do not provide a caller-friendly API, e.g. `LinkedList#append(Node<T> n)` instead of `LinkedList#append(T t)` or use visibility modifiers for access control because readability is key.
